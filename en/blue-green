It is always good to put an application in production. The feeling of a well job done, to have our client happy 
and our client's customers using it. Which developer doesn't love it? Better than it is to have a way to update the
production application with 0 downtime. It is like to fuel an airplane on the fly.The feeling is awesome but to achieve it 
is not that simple, you need to worry with database consistency, active sections and the list goes on.

Here at [Codelitt](http://www.codelitt.com/) we have set it up in a simple but really good way to achieve it with 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
