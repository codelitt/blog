Here at [Codelitt](http://www.codelitt.com/) we decided to use a tool to centralize our logs. The best self hosted version that we found was [Graylog](graylog.org). It offers a rich web client with a lot of filters and graphics.

To set it up they offer a good documentation, but as we strive to have [12Factor](12factor.net) compliant services and applications we've organized a HOW-TO with it and docker&docker-compose.

In case you are setting up a new server take a look in our [server security practices](https://github.com/codelittinc/incubator-resources/blob/master/best_practices/servers.md)
